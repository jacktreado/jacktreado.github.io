I use computational physics to study a wide variety of biological problems. From packing in the core of individual protein molecules to tumor invasion and tissue development, my work focuses on developing simple physical models of complex biological phenomena.

Most of my work looks something this:

This is a simulation of a [deformable particle](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.248003) that crawls similarly to a [real cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wody4fGscs) by protruding its perimeter and dragging itself in that direction.

Models like this may lack some microscopic details, but they allow us to ask important questions. For example, 
* How do different migration strategies balance shape change with crawling speed?
* What happens when multiple cells move collectively? 
* Why have certain strategies evolved over others?

For more scientific details, see recent publications [here](publications.md).

I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science department at Yale University, working in [Corey O'Hern's](https://jamming.research.yale.edu/) group.
