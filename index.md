# Jack (John D.) Treado
## PhD Candidate - Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, Yale University

I am currently a graduate student in [Corey O'Hern's](https://jamming.research.yale.edu/) group at Yale. I study collective cell motion, tissue organization and tissue mechanics using computational physics. 

I go by Jack, but publish by my given name (John D. Treado). Sorry for any confusion!

For any inquiries, please email me at [john.treado@yale.edu](mailto:john.treado@yale.edu).
